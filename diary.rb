# Dependency-less clone of the awesome shell script "diary" which can be found
# here:
#
#   http://sourceforge.net/projects/diary/
#
# This version won't be compatible anymore.
#
# All loaded libraries should be shipped with ruby itself. So there is no need
# to install any gem to run this script.
